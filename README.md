### UC Berkeley Forecasting Final Project
#### Henry Maier, May 2022
This is the final project for the Forecasting class at UC Berkeley. I give a forecast for the annual snow total at Palisades Tahoe Resort for the 2022-2023 season.

Playing around with the notebook should be relatively straightforward with the necessary dependencies installed):
- clone the repo
- run `jupyter notebook .`
- open the `notebooks/snow_forecasting_analysis.ipynb` notebook
- ???

Enjoy!
